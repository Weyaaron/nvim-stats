# nvim_stats

This code aims to implement a neovim plugin for capturing your programming activities,
with a particular focus on keystrokes.
The data is then aggretaded to visualize your workflow.

As of 2024-08, this is very much WIP. Juggling working on this with my other life activities
will be tough. There might be months without activity. The currently provided version
is the third version of the rough idea outlined above, there might be more reworks needet.
Development will happen on main until this notice is deleted.

# Differences to other 'similar' plugins
This is no comprehensive list, if you find something provides what this plugin aims for
please let me know, I appreciate it.

[Pulse](https://github.com/creativecreature/pulse)
- My plugin wont use a server/online setup
- Pulse is not about data specific to vim
- Pulse is not about improvments to your workflow


# Goals
- Eventually capture most inputs, including counters, registers etc
- Provide graphs and summaries for your workflow
- Suggest improvments that fit your current usage

# Non-Goals
- Comparisons with the workflow/setup of others
- Overwhelm you with data that is insignificant
